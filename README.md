## 📌 Executive Summary

The **Mental Health Tech EDA** project explores a dataset related to mental health in the technology industry to uncover patterns, trends, and insights about employee mental health behavior, workplace characteristics, and support availability.

This analysis provides meaningful insights that can help HR professionals, business leaders, and workplace wellness teams make data-driven decisions to improve employee support systems and mental wellness policies.

## 🏢 Business Problem

Mental health is a critical concern in today’s workforce, especially in high-pressure tech environments. Organizations often lack clarity about:

- Which demographic groups are most affected?
- How workplace culture impacts mental health support?
- What factors predict whether an employee seeks support?
- Are employees aware of available mental health resources?
- How can companies improve policies and support mechanisms?

Without analytical insights, workplace strategies to improve employee mental health may not be effective or targeted.

This project aims to quantify trends and highlight actionable insights for better people management and wellness programs.

## 🧪 Methodology

The project followed a structured analytical workflow:

### 1️⃣ Data Understanding
- Reviewed dataset structure and variables
- Identified key fields related to mental health and workplace

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Handled missing and inconsistent values
- Standardized categorical values
- Converted data types where necessary
- Derived new features (if applicable) such as tenure groups or awareness levels

### 3️⃣ SQL-Driven Exploration (if applied)

Key SQL skills used:
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)** for subqueries
- **Joins** to combine related tables (if multiple datasets used)
- **CASE statements** for conditional categorization
- Aggregations using `GROUP BY`
- Data filtering using `WHERE`

### 4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Demographic distributions (age, gender, location)
- Mental health support availability vs. access
- Correlation between workplace attributes and support seeking
- Visualization of key trends
